Very simple to cook

Preheat the oven to 356°F (180°C).
Take a serving plate and spread nachos onto it.
Spread bell peppers, onions, and cheese over the nachos.
Sprinkle chili flakes and oregano.
Cover the filling with a new layer of nachos and repeat the process until you get three to four layers.
Put these in the oven for five minutes or until the cheese starts to sizzle.
Serve while still hot, with lemonade or fruit shakes.

And enjoy it!
